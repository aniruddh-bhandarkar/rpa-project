# rpa-project
RPA Project done during mid 2021
Robotic Process Automation(RPA) has application in many fields including Business Admistration, Finance Automation.

It does not require programming Language other than the RPA platform.The building block of RPA is Application Program Interface(API).

For this project I have used SAP based UI5 Fiori which is an intellingent RPA(iRPA).
The benefits of using Fiori include the following:
 <ol>Visual user interface design</ol>
 <ol>Repository for bot skills </ol>
 <ol>Analytics for pre built bots</ol>
 <ol>Easy Integration</ol>
 <ol>Fast Implementation</ol>
